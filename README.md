# Platr Employee exam v1.0

Welcome to Platr's employee exam. The aim of these assignments is gathering a better overview of your understanding of
Angular, ability to solve common problems, and seeking code optimizations where you deem necessary. There, for the
most part, is no one correct answer. We want to see how you do things, find possible workarounds, and general coding
style.

**Important note:** This project is littered with small issues and possible improvements that can be made to the code.
Find and fix as many of them as you can find (this is a part of the evaluation).
